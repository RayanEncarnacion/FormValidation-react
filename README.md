# Form Validation  -  React

<a href="https://rayan-validation.netlify.app/" target="_blank">LIVE APP</a> <br>

This is just a practice project to validate data provided by the user trough a form while maintaining a nice UX.

## How I build this?

1 - Created a register schema for the validation using yup.

2 - Managed the form submittion in a custom hook using useForm with my yup schema as the resolver.

3 - Added conditional paragraph tags to display any errors in the form.

## What I've used to build this project?

```
React
yup (Validation library)
useForm (Form submittion managment Hook)
```
