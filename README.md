# FormValidation-react

## Simple form validation

This is just a practice project to learn how to use useForm (React Hook) and yup (Validation library) to come up with a nice UX while validating all the data provided by the user.

## How I build this?

1 - I created a register schema for the validation using yup.

2 - Managed the form submittion in a custom hook using useForm with my yup schema as the resolver.

3 - Added conditional paragprah tags to display any errors in the form.
